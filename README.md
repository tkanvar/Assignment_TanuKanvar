1.	Create a button to fetch user data. 
2.	Use api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users to fetch user details, show the details in the table.
3.	All the nested columns such as address, company should be combined in one cell. 
For example: 
address": {
      "street": "Kulas Light",
      "suite": "Apt. 556",
      "city": "Gwenborough",
      "zipcode": "92998-3874",
      "geo": {
        "lat": "-37.3159",
        "lng": "81.1496"
      }
In the table address should be 
Kulas Light, Apt. 556, Gwenborough, 92998-3874, -37.3159,81.1496
Use same logic to combine all nested columns.

4.	Provide sorting on each column.
5.	Provide filtering functionality for name and email and for the table, use search using text search and use the same button which you have initially created to fetch user Data to filter the data. 
User will write text in filter box and search box and click on filter button then filtering will happen
6.	Ensure the solution is scalable to handle potential future growth in data volume or features.
7.	Dynamically generate column headers based on the fetched data to adapt to changes.
